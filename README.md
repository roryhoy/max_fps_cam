# max_fps_cam
A small Max patcher for mouse movement mapped to jit.gl.camera rotate messages.

Bring the **first_person_camera** abstraction into your patch.

A sample patch with a basic Jitter world and camera is also provided (**fps_example_world**).

For a more traditional FPS feel with grounded camera movement and WASD controls, check out the **fps_physics_example_world**. Note: this is relatively rough, but should give a good idea on how to implement this kind of control into your world.
